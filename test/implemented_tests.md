# Tests

A list of the tests implemented. See TODO.md for the roadmap.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## OSX

### Installation

* We should test the scripts/create_user.sh script, because on that depends the installation and execution of the agent.
* We should test 'config activate' under different conditions. It is essential to make Prey work (e.g. 'current' dir is created as well as log file).
* We should test OS install/uninstall hooks under different conditions. They are also necessary for installations and updates to be completed.

### Main/Execution

* What happens when bin/prey is called without params.
  - `cli.js` should be called
